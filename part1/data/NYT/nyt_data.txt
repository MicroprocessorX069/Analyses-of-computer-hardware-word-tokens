plenty inaccurate conventional wisdom methods prolong battery life lets start one worst tips closing forcequitting commonly called apps currently using theory apps running background using phones components quitting save energy 
may true computer smartphones designed differently app longer foreground meaning actively using processes frozen words app may still loaded phones memory probably much background drain battery 
finally quitting apps actually drawbacks forcequit app code purged phones ram means next time open app phone reload code course requires energy 
common suggestion extending battery life disable wifi however youre range strong wifi signal phone uses less energy connect internet wifi connection cellular one regularly use apps rely location wifi enabled helps phone determine location without rely solely powerhungry gps features actually helps battery last longer 
exception youre edges wifi network phone struggling get good connection good cellular data connection cases youre usually better keeping wifi enabled 
many apps use location intermittently even using maps app short navigation sessions doesnt use percent batterys capacity phones screen continually big part navigation uses lot power 
words dont disable phones locationbased features extend battery life wont see big jump use time may end disabling subsequently missing useful features instead check using tips see apps consuming battery life track location dont need location tracking consider disabling apps 
many people even smartphone vendors apple claim using wifi wireless data consumes less power using cellular signal use wifi whenever however wirecutters testing found isnt always case 
testing location wifi cellular lte signals strong hour browsing wifi used roughly amount battery power hour using lte iphone motorola android phone lte used percent power wifi 
words long good signal probably wont see huge difference wifi cellular data probably worth hassle switching two 
iphones android phones include handsfree feature summoning virtual assistants speaking voice commands say hey siri iphone ok google speak request command convenient feature requires phone constantly listen special phrase uses power 
yet one phones supports feature disabling wont conserve much battery life wirecutters testing iphone plus nexus negligible difference battery usage alwayson virtual assistant enabled disabled twohour period

applications go far beyond original ambitions mr huang born taiwan studied electrical engineering oregon state university stanford taking jobs silicon valley chipmakers started nvidia chris malachowsky curtis priem setting initially help pcs offer visual effects rival dedicated video game consoles 
companys original product dud mr malachowsky said graphics market attracted mob rivals 
nvidia retooled products strategy gradually separated competition become clear leader gpuaccelerator cards used gaming pcs 
gpus generate triangles form framelike structures simulating objects applying colors pixels display screen many simple instructions must executed parallel graphics chips evolved many tiny processors new gpu announced nvidia may called volta processors new highend intel server chip contrast larger generalpurpose processor cores 
nvidia began cuda push hiring ian buck stanford doctoral student company intern worked programming challenge involved making easier harness gpus many calculating engines nvidia soon made changes chips developed software aids including support standard programming language rather arcane tools used issue commands graphics chips 
company built cuda consumer gpus highend products decision critical mr buck said meant researchers students owned laptops desktop pcs gaming tinker software campus labs dorm rooms nvidia convinced many universities offer courses new programming techniques 
programmers gradually adopted gpus applications used among things climate modeling oil gas discovery new phase began canadian researchers began apply cuda gpus unusually large neural networks manylayered software required deep learning

many consumers relate despite leaps forward mobile phone technology crisp clear screens faster chips batteries made sluggish progress propelled desire longer battery life top list factors considered consumers purchase smartphones according survey research firm idc 
battery technology still underwhelming plenty companies developing smarter battery technology years including methods increase battery capacity tenfold charge devices pulling energy air lithium ion technology mainstream batteries based low cost easily reproducible safe well stuck foreseeable future said charlie quong executive mophie battery accessory maker interview 
theres lot investments fronts improving technology beyond dont think going see hitting kind mass market several years mr quong said general lithium ion improves percent year terms amount energy stored given space partly consumers perceive batteries far behind technologies 
backdrop mind teamed wirecutter product recommendations website run array tests determine best worst practices preserving battery life smartphones still need extra juice wirecutter picked external battery products 
results showed conventional beliefs extending battery life like turning wifi shutting phones apps produced negligible even harmful results wirecutter found plenty helpful practices get use battery like playing music stored directly device instead streaming tweaking email configurations 
wirecutter tested range recent apple android smartphones latest operating systems tightly controlled environments phones results vary depending phone model cellular carrier location factors general results hold eight tips seven myths busted findings 
smartphones screen consumes energy component easiest way cut battery drain reduce screen brightness hourlong test iphone used percent less battery power screen brightness minimum compared maximum brightness android test phone used percent less 
tough use dim screen bright environments phones offer autobrightness mode automatically adjusts screens brightness based ambient light wirecutter found enabling autobrightness saved good amount battery life

wirecutter tested iphone plus configured three email accounts receiving total messages hour tests push active course day caused mail account percent phones overall battery use 
save energy phones configured instead check fetch emails schedule say every minutes manually tell email app refresh 
next tip may come unwelcome news nowadays online streaming popular way listen music services like spotify pandora apple music method guzzles lots battery power wirecutters tests streaming music wifi connection two hours used percent iphones battery reserves streaming music stored directly device two hours consumed percent 
fortunately streaming services like spotify apple music still let listen songs oldschool way storing music right device 
may noticed youre place without good wifi cellular coverage phones battery seems drain much quickly thats phone uses energy searching good signal signal weak trying get better connection 
conserve battery life disable phones wireless circuitry airplane mode option turn wireless features quick easy solution areas poor reception 
alternatively disable phones settings single wireless feature example terrible wireless carrier coverage office wifi great disabling cellular connectivity keep phone wasting energy trying get cellular connection still letting connect internet wifi 
consumers get even better results bit sleuthing iphone android systems provide simple way see apps using lot battery power iphones android phones open settings app battery menu sorted lists apps using energy 
iphones battery usage screen tap clock button reveal information much battery life app consuming youre actively using app screen compared youre backgd android useful information timers cpu total cpu foreground foreground much time app open subtract foreground total youll know much time app busy background

plenty inaccurate conventional wisdom methods prolong battery life lets start one worst tips closing forcequitting commonly called apps currently using theory apps running background using phones components quitting save energy 
may true computer smartphones designed differently app longer foreground meaning actively using processes frozen words app may still loaded phones memory probably much background drain battery 
finally quitting apps actually drawbacks forcequit app code purged phones ram means next time open app phone reload code course requires energy 
common suggestion extending battery life disable wifi however youre range strong wifi signal phone uses less energy connect internet wifi connection cellular one regularly use apps rely location wifi enabled helps phone determine location without rely solely powerhungry gps features actually helps battery last longer 
exception youre edges wifi network phone struggling get good connection good cellular data connection cases youre usually better keeping wifi enabled 
many apps use location intermittently even using maps app short navigation sessions doesnt use percent batterys capacity phones screen continually big part navigation uses lot power 
words dont disable phones locationbased features extend battery life wont see big jump use time may end disabling subsequently missing useful features instead check using tips see apps consuming battery life track location dont need location tracking consider disabling apps 
many people even smartphone vendors apple claim using wifi wireless data consumes less power using cellular signal use wifi whenever however wirecutters testing found isnt always case 
testing location wifi cellular lte signals strong hour browsing wifi used roughly amount battery power hour using lte iphone motorola android phone lte used percent power wifi 
words long good signal probably wont see huge difference wifi cellular data probably worth hassle switching two 
iphones android phones include handsfree feature summoning virtual assistants speaking voice commands say hey siri iphone ok google speak request command convenient feature requires phone constantly listen special phrase uses power 
yet one phones supports feature disabling wont conserve much battery life wirecutters testing iphone plus nexus negligible difference battery usage alwayson virtual assistant enabled disabled twohour period 
using siri ok google uses energy phones battery getting low probably stop asking phone question question commute feature enabled isnt worth worrying quite convenient 
common warning around internet use charger came phone otherwise damage phones battery reality phone contains circuitry responsible charging battery ac adapter accurately known simply converts ac current wall outlet lowvoltage lowamperage dc current provides via usb port charge phone using usb port computer usb battery pack charger car phone designed allow charge variety power sources produce wide range current 
finally may see warnings cheap thirdparty charger damage phone theres truth many chargers especially budget models sold online even local shopping mall kiosk poorly made use lowquality components poorly made charger damage phone hurt exposing dangerous currents youre replacing phones ac adapter buying extra stick reputable vendor 
many years devices used rechargeable batteries required conditioning calibrating procedure prevented battery forgetting much capacity actually todays smartphone batteries longer suffer issue 
happen however phone loses track much capacity battery every battery gradually loses capacity time use recharge phones software isnt always good accounting capacity change periodically every couple months fully charging phone using dies phones software determine batterys current capacity thus let phone better estimate long last charge words battery wont last longer phones battery meter accurate find phone claims percent charge left dies hours later try procedure

new york soon join seven states done away unjust policy letting employers pay waiters bartenders tipped workers less minimum wage move help lift thousands lowincome families poverty 
much country tipped workers live parallel universe far labor law concerned federal law employers pay workers little per hour rate changed since long hourly wages plus tips add hour discrepancy hurts workers putting greater risk wage theft sexual harassment workplace exploitation bosses easily withhold steal tips especially workers dont like refuse propositions hardly idle threats demonstrated recent allegations abuse prominent chefs restaurant owners multimilliondollar wage theft settlements workers secured recent years suing unscrupulous employers department labors wage hour division estimated nearly percent fullservice restaurants investigated violated labor standards including limited tip violations 
states including many higher minimum wage federally required maintain subminimum wage tipped workers number million nationwide new york city minimum wage tipped workers businesses employees compared hour workers gov andrew cuomo directed labor commissioner roberta reardon hold hearings starting next month whether state eliminate discrepancy administrative action 
restaurant industry asserts raising tipped wage hurt small businesses forcing close mr cuomo ms reardon swayed scare tactic doubt bringing tipped workers minimum wage reduce profits businesses experiences states show devastate industry consider california decades required businesses pay tipped employees minimum wage workers get yet state thriving restaurant scene includes everything momandpop taquerias fine dining establishments look heated debates foodie circles relative merits eating new york versus los angeles san francisco 
restaurants open close time hard find stories businesses went minimumwage increase report two cornell professors found little evidence raising minimum wage hurt industry even national restaurant association projects next decade employment industry grow percent california percent new york 
another common industry argument raising tipped minimum wage ultimately bad workers customers tip less thinking goes know restaurants must pay waiters bartenders least regular minimum wage theres evidence back claim waiters tipped workers california six states without subminimum tipped wage alaska washington oregon nevada montana minnesota earn money less likely live poverty according government data analyzed economic policy institute research organization eighth state hawaii effectively eliminated subminimum wage letting businesses pay tipped workers cents hour less states minimum wage workers earn least hour tips 
industry executives protest giving tipped workers raise exacerbate income inequality waiters workers receive tips like line cooks dishwashers one disingenuous arguments trump administration used justify proposal give restaurant management complete control tips dont fall restaurants actually concerned welfare backofthehouse employees pay improve grueling conditions work follow example restaurateurs like danny meyer eliminated tipping folding cost service menu prices mixed results 
best restaurant employees industry moved away tipping model realistically speaking tips going away anytime soon important state federal lawmakers make sure waiters staffers rely gratuities guaranteed minimum wage workers

new york soon join seven states done away unjust policy letting employers pay waiters bartenders tipped workers less minimum wage move help lift thousands lowincome families poverty 
much country tipped workers live parallel universe far labor law concerned federal law employers pay workers little per hour rate changed since long hourly wages plus tips add hour discrepancy hurts workers putting greater risk wage theft sexual harassment workplace exploitation bosses easily withhold steal tips especially workers dont like refuse propositions hardly idle threats demonstrated recent allegations abuse prominent chefs restaurant owners multimilliondollar wage theft settlements workers secured recent years suing unscrupulous employers department labors wage hour division estimated nearly percent fullservice restaurants investigated violated labor standards including limited tip violations 
states including many higher minimum wage federally required maintain subminimum wage tipped workers number million nationwide new york city minimum wage tipped workers businesses employees compared hour workers gov andrew cuomo directed labor commissioner roberta reardon hold hearings starting next month whether state eliminate discrepancy administrative action

restaurants open close time hard find stories businesses went minimumwage increase report two cornell professors found little evidence raising minimum wage hurt industry even national restaurant association projects next decade employment industry grow percent california percent new york 
another common industry argument raising tipped minimum wage ultimately bad workers customers tip less thinking goes know restaurants must pay waiters bartenders least regular minimum wage theres evidence back claim waiters tipped workers california six states without subminimum tipped wage alaska washington oregon nevada montana minnesota earn money less likely live poverty according government data analyzed economic policy institute research organization eighth state hawaii effectively eliminated subminimum wage letting businesses pay tipped workers cents hour less states minimum wage workers earn least hour tips

new york soon join seven states done away unjust policy letting employers pay waiters bartenders tipped workers less minimum wage move help lift thousands lowincome families poverty 
much country tipped workers live parallel universe far labor law concerned federal law employers pay workers little per hour rate changed since long hourly wages plus tips add hour discrepancy hurts workers putting greater risk wage theft sexual harassment workplace exploitation bosses easily withhold steal tips especially workers dont like refuse propositions hardly idle threats demonstrated recent allegations abuse prominent chefs restaurant owners multimilliondollar wage theft settlements workers secured recent years suing unscrupulous employers department labors wage hour division estimated nearly percent fullservice restaurants investigated violated labor standards including limited tip violations 
states including many higher minimum wage federally required maintain subminimum wage tipped workers number million nationwide new york city minimum wage tipped workers businesses employees compared hour workers gov andrew cuomo directed labor commissioner roberta reardon hold hearings starting next month whether state eliminate discrepancy administrative action 
restaurant industry asserts raising tipped wage hurt small businesses forcing close mr cuomo ms reardon swayed scare tactic doubt bringing tipped workers minimum wage reduce profits businesses experiences states show devastate industry consider california decades required businesses pay tipped employees minimum wage workers get yet state thriving restaurant scene includes everything momandpop taquerias fine dining establishments look heated debates foodie circles relative merits eating new york versus los angeles san francisco 
restaurants open close time hard find stories businesses went minimumwage increase report two cornell professors found little evidence raising minimum wage hurt industry even national restaurant association projects next decade employment industry grow percent california percent new york 
another common industry argument raising tipped minimum wage ultimately bad workers customers tip less thinking goes know restaurants must pay waiters bartenders least regular minimum wage theres evidence back claim waiters tipped workers california six states without subminimum tipped wage alaska washington oregon nevada montana minnesota earn money less likely live poverty according government data analyzed economic policy institute research organization eighth state hawaii effectively eliminated subminimum wage letting businesses pay tipped workers cents hour less states minimum wage workers earn least hour tips
